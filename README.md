Digit Recognition (MNIST) using CNN

In this implementation, I tried to use Convolutional Neural Network for classifying MNIST dataset.

You guys can download dataset from link:

In repository, you can see 2 jupyter notebook files:

Digit_Regonizer_Model: Example result.
Digit_Regonizer: CNN structure, train and test.
